# The-Gaming-Room

1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
A: My client, The Gaming Room, sought a web-based game that could run on various platforms. They requested the development of software based on their existing Android app, "Draw It or Lose It," to enable cross-platform access.

2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
A: In developing this documentation, one notable strength was my ability to articulate my findings clearly and concisely. For instance, I was clearly able to articulate the similarities and differences between memory and storage management. 

3. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
A: When working through the design document, I benefited from the structured approach, allowing me to develop code in an organized and procedural manner.

4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
A: If I were to revise one part of this work, it would be the Domain Model section, aiming to enhance the analysis of the UML diagram by providing more detail and clarity.

5. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
A: To meet the user's needs, I comprehensively assessed their existing system and gathered their specific requirements. It's crucial to consider user needs in the design phase to ensure that the final product aligns closely with their expectations.

6. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
A: My approach to software design involved thoroughly understanding the client's current setup and requirements. In the future, I would continue to employ structured techniques and strategies, such as requirement gathering, prototyping, and thorough testing, to analyze and design similar software applications.
